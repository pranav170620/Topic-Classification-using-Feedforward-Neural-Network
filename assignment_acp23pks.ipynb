    "# [COM6513] Assignment: Topic Classification with a Feedforward Network\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructor: Nikos Aletras\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to develop a Feedforward neural network for topic classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For that purpose, you will implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text processing methods for transforming raw text data into input vectors for your network  (**1 mark**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Feedforward network consisting of:\n",
    "    - **One-hot** input layer mapping words into an **Embedding weight matrix** (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - **One hidden layer** computing the mean embedding vector of all words in input followed by a **ReLU activation function** (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - **Output layer** with a **softmax** activation. (**1 mark**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm with **back-propagation** to learn the weights of your Neural network. Your algorithm should:\n",
    "    - Use (and minimise) the **Categorical Cross-entropy loss** function (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - Perform a **Forward pass** to compute intermediate outputs (**2 marks**)\n",
    "    - Perform a **Backward pass** to compute gradients and update all sets of weights (**3 marks**)\n",
    "    - Implement and use **Dropout** after each hidden layer for regularisation (**1 marks**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss how did you choose hyperparameters? You can tune the learning rate (hint: choose small values), embedding size {e.g. 50, 300, 500} and the dropout rate {e.g. 0.2, 0.5}. Please use tables or graphs to show training and validation performance for each hyperparameter combination  (**2 marks**). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- After training a model, plot the learning process (i.e. training and validation loss in each epoch) using a line plot and report accuracy. Does your model overfit, underfit or is about right? (**1 mark**).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Re-train your network by using pre-trained embeddings ([GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)) trained on large corpora. Instead of randomly initialising the embedding weights matrix, you should initialise it with the pre-trained weights. During training, you should not update them (i.e. weight freezing) and backprop should stop before computing gradients for updating embedding weights. Report results by performing hyperparameter tuning and plotting the learning process. Do you get better performance? (**1 marks**).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extend you Feedforward network by adding more hidden layers (e.g. one more or two). How does it affect the performance? Note: You need to repeat hyperparameter tuning, but the number of combinations grows exponentially. Therefore, you need to choose a subset of all possible combinations (**3 marks**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide well documented and commented code describing all of your choices. In general, you are free to make decisions about text processing (e.g. punctuation, numbers, vocabulary size) and hyperparameter values. We expect to see justifications and discussion for all of your choices. You must provide detailed explanations of your implementation, provide a detailed analysis of the results (e.g. why a model performs better than other models etc.) including error analyses (e.g. examples and discussion/analysis of missclasifications etc.)  (**10 marks**). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide efficient solutions by using Numpy arrays when possible. Executing the whole notebook with your code should not take more than 10 minutes on any standard computer (e.g. Intel Core i5 CPU, 8 or 16GB RAM) excluding hyperparameter tuning runs and loading the pretrained vectors. You can find tips in Lab 1 (**2 marks**). \n",
    "\n",

    "### Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will use for the task is a subset of the [AG News Corpus](http://groups.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html) and you can find it in the `./data_topic` folder in CSV format:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data_topic/train.csv`: contains 2,400 news articles, 800 for each class to be used for training.\n",
    "- `data_topic/dev.csv`: contains 150 news articles, 50 for each class to be used for hyperparameter selection and monitoring the training process.\n",
    "- `data_topic/test.csv`: contains 900 news articles, 300 for each class to be used for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class 1: Politics, Class 2: Sports, Class 3: Economy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-trained Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download pre-trained GloVe embeddings trained on Common Crawl (840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, cased, 300d vectors, 2.03 GB download) from [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip). No need to unzip, the file is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Save Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "To save RAM, when you finish each experiment you can delete the weights of your network using `del W` followed by Python's garbage collector `gc.collect()`\n",

    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You **must** submit a Jupyter Notebook file (assignment_yourusername.ipynb) and an exported PDF version (you can do it from Jupyter: `File->Download as->PDF via Latex`, you need to have a Latex distribution installed e.g. MikTex or MacTex and pandoc). If you are unable to export the pdf via Latex, you can print the notebook web page to a pdf file from your browser (e.g. on Firefox: File->Print->Save to PDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are advised to follow the code structure given in this notebook by completing all given funtions. You can also write any auxilliary/helper functions (and arguments for the functions) that you might need but note that you can provide a full solution without any such functions. Similarly, you can just use only the packages imported below but you are free to use any functionality from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html), NumPy, SciPy (excluding built-in softmax funtcions) and Pandas. You are **not allowed to use any third-party library** such as Scikit-learn (apart from metric functions already provided), NLTK, Spacy, Keras, Pytorch etc.. You should mention if you've used Windows to write and test your code because we mostly use Unix based machines for marking (e.g. Ubuntu, MacOS). \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single correct answer on what your accuracy should be, but correct implementations usually achieve F1-scores around 80\\% or higher. The quality of the analysis of the results and discussion is as important as the implementation and accuracy of your models. Please be brief and consice in your discussion and analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will be marked out of 30. It is worth 30\\% of your final grade in the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deadline for this assignment is **23:59 on Mon, 12 Apr 2024** and it needs to be submitted via Blackboard. Standard departmental penalties for lateness will be applied. We use a range of strategies to **detect [unfair means](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/unfair-means/index)**, including Turnitin which helps detect plagiarism. Use of unfair means would result in getting a failing grade.\n",

The entire process was supported by empirical evidence, ensuring the models effectiveness and efficiency.\n"

    "When refining the neural network with GloVe pre-trained embeddings, I concentrated on optimizing key hyperparameters to improve text classification performance. To take advantage of their comprehensive semantic representations, the embedding dimension was set to 300, in accordance with GloVe standards. I focused on the learning rate and dropout rate as key factors influencing training dynamics and the model's ability to generalize. Following testing, a learning rate of 0.0001 and a dropout rate of 0.02 were determined. These values effectively reduced loss and prevented overfitting, ensuring that the model remained robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained for 50 epochs, with early stopping used to maximize computational efficiency and avoid over-training. A systematic grid search across these parameters confirmed their efficacy, as evidenced by higher validation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This careful, iterative tuning process ensured that the final model settings were empirically validated, resulting in a well-optimized model suitable for robust text classification tasks.\n"

In addition, I chose a dropout rate of 0.2 to strike a balance between avoiding overfitting and maintaining enough model complexity to capture intricate patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's architecture featured two hidden layers with 200 and 100, respectively. This configuration added the necessary non-linearity to model complex relationships while not significantly taxing computational resources. I also used a strict tolerance of 0.00001 for early stopping to reduce training when improvements were no longer significant, thereby preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A grid search method was used to rigorously compare various combinations of these hyperparameters to validation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This meticulous process not only helped identify the most effective parameters, but also provided empirical evidence of their superiority in improving accuracy and generalization on previously unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this thorough and empirical approach to hyperparameter tuning guaranteed that our final model was robust, well-tuned, and highly capable of performing text classification tasks effectively.\n"

    "The model that incorporates Average Embedding with pre-trained GloVe embeddings and additional hidden layers really stands out due to its sophisticated design, which is tailor-made for tackling the intricacies of text classification. Integrating these pre-trained embeddings was a game-changer because it provided the model with a rich foundation of pre-existing language knowledge, giving us a head start. The additional layers, on the other hand, added much-needed depth, enabling the model to uncover and learn from the complex patterns and relationships hidden within the text data.\n",

    "What this means in practical terms is that the model got really good at understanding and handling the nuances of language, something that the simpler models just couldn't match. This is reflected in the improved scores across precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Essentially, the model became better at making precise classifications and reduced its overall error rate, even in tricky situations.\n",

    "The error analysis showed that the model still struggled with ambiguities and rare words that it hadn't encountered enough during training. It sometimes got tripped up by subtle contextual clues or mixed up texts from similar categories. "
